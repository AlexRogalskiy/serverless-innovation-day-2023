### Opening

- [Keynote – Modernize with AWS Serverless with Holly Mesrobian, VP, Serverless Compute](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=1023)

- [Your Questions with Ajay Nair, GM, Lambda, AWS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=1572)


### Group A - Event-Driven Architecture
- [Visualizing the fundamentals of Event-Driven Architectures by David Boyne](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=2901)
    - Event-driven architectures (EDA) are becoming increasingly popular for building scalable and resilient distributed systems. However, understanding the fundamentals of EDA can be a challenge due to their complex and asynchronous nature. In this talk, we will explore the fundamentals of EDA, patterns that can help and help you gain a better understanding of the key concepts behind EDA.

- [Building with serverless workflows at scale](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=4455)
  - Are you an experienced serverless developer building applications with AWS Step Functions workflows? Do you want a guide for unleashing the full power of Step Functions for your production workloads? Are you wondering whether to choose an Express or a Standard workflow? Or whether to use a map state, a parallel state or a nested workflow? In this session, learn about architectural best practices and repeatable patterns for building workflows and cost optimizations, and discover handy cheat codes that you can use to build secure, high-scale, high-performance serverless applications. Real production scenarios illustrate the benefits.

- [Event design and event first development](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=6063)
  - Events are at the core of any event-driven application as they help us reduce coupling between systems and increase the agility of teams. The design and contracts of your events play an important part of how your distributed architecture is built, and determine how it scales and handles faults. Getting your event design right can help you scale your event-driven architecture within your organization.
In this session, you will learn a robust approach to event design with Amazon EventBridge, the common event patterns used, the importance of designing events at the start of development, and how event structure can impact your architecture.

- [How Pentasoft implemented Event-Driven Architectures](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=7335)
  - Learn how Pentasoft implemented event-driven technology, including patterns like CQRS and fan-out, to enhance their production systems from the backend to the frontend. Discover the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned from their journey towards a scalable, flexible, and resilient event-driven architecture, using services like Amazon EventBridge, AWS SNS, AWS SQS, and Amazon IoT Core.

### Group B: Serverless Containers on ECS with Fargate

- [Scaling performance for containers using Amazon ECS with Amazon EFS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=9859)
  - Many succesful large organizations rely on Amazon ECS to massively scale as their business demands increase. In this session we discuss capacity providers, service autoscaling, limits and quotas, as well as best practices for building scalable infrastructure. 

- [Customer fireside chat with Spencer Dillard, Director, Software Development, AWS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=10388) 

- [Customer fireside chat with Nick Coult, GM, Elastic Container Services, AWS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=11318)

- [Scaling from one container to a million using Amazon ECS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=12241)
  - Many succesful large organizations rely on Amazon ECS to massively scale as their business demands increase. In this session we discuss capacity providers, service autoscaling, limits and quotas, as well as best practices for building scalable infrastructure.

- [Optimizing for Cost using Amazon ECS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=13774)
  - In this session, we will show you how to reduce operational overhead from the control plane with Amazon ECS. Come learn how to use containers for binpacking workloads, efficient scaling techniques, cost savings plans, co-pilot, blueprints, and Graviton.

- [Using Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate as your Gateway to Serverless](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=15165)
  - Choice is the key benefit of using a hyperscale cloud provider, and that goes double for where and how to run containerized workloads. In this session, learn about concrete decision points, practical advice, and benefits you may not have considered as you choose how to build and scale your app.

- [Containers fundamentals with Amazon ECS ‐ Everything a Kubernetes Expert Needs to Know](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=16322)
  - Increasingly, customers are moving away from managing their own infrastructure and control plane to focusing on developing the best software they can using Amazon ECS. In this session we'll talk directly to the people impacted the most by that choice: the Kubernetes management team. If you are an expert in Kubernetes and want to see what life without infrastructure burden looks like.

### Group C: Lambda-based Applications

- [Customer fireside chat with Ajay Nair, GM, Lambda, AWS](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=18029)

- [Serverless analytics at scale](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=18935)
  - Serverless is more than just AWS Lambda. It’s about learning to use a range of different services and techniques to solve a customer problem. How do you approach building a solution with a serverless mindset? In this talk, learn how to tackle a business problem by breaking down the needs into serverless building blocks that work well together.

- [Building serverless applications with infrastructure as code](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=20445)
  - Many developers build their first serverless application in the AWS Lambda console. While great for learning, this is not a scalable method for building serverless applications. In this session, learn how to move from the console to the AWS SAM framework. See how to construct serverless applications that can be versioned and deployed repeatably across multiple environments. Learn how to develop, debug, and deploy your serverless applications with the command line. By the end of this session, understand how to start building a serverless application on your laptop and take it to production without leaving your favorite IDE.

- [Best practices for AWS Lambda](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=21853)
  - Learn best practices for getting the most out of AWS Lambda. Understand the Lambda lifecycle and how Lambda scales to ensure your functions can run at scale. Find out code optimization tips to speed up function processing, reduce costs, and write less code. Learn how to optimize your memory to do even more with Lambda.

- [Building interactive applications with AWS Lambda](https://www.youtube.com/live/KEMRyxf2oPk?feature=share&t=23253)
  - In this session, learn best practices and architectural patterns for building web and mobile backends as well as API-driven microservices on AWS Lambda. Explore how to take advantage of features in AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and more to easily build highly scalable serverless web applications.
